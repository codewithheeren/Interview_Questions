user story estimation -   
Break down the user story: If the user story is too large, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks or sub-stories.

10 . Use relative sizing: Assign story points to each user story based on its relative complexity, effort, and uncertainty compared to the reference story. The Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.) or a similar scale is often used.
